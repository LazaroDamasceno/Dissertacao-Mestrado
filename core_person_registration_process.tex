\section{Core Person Registration Process}
\label{core_person_registration_process}

The figure \ref{fig:person_registration_flow} is an activity diagram that shows visually the flow of the registration of a \textbf{Person}. As evidenced by \cite{alfedaghi2021validationconceptualversusactivity}, a UML activity diagram is a semi-formal semantic specification that is intuitive and flexible. It is used to describe a system's behaviors and the internal logic of complex operations. Therefore, it is widely utilized as a front-end tool for the system-level design of software and hardware systems.

If the verification discovers that the provided SSN or email is already associated with a persisted \textbf{Person}, it is retrieved. Otherwise, a new instance of \textbf{Person} is created and persisted.
